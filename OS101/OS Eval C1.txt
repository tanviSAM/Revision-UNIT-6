Q1. a)Difference between tight coupling and loose coupling.
    b) What is the Difference between High Cohesion and Low Cohesion? Also provide Examples.

a) A Loose coupling helps in following GOF program principle to interface, where as Tight coupling provides no concept of interface.
   A Loose coupling improves test ability unlike Tight coupling that is not good at the test-ability.
   A Loose coupling is highly changeable whereas a Tight coupling has no such capability.
   In a Loose coupling it is much easier to swap codes between classes as compaired to Tight coupling.

b) HC: gives better-maintaining facility
   LC: is hard to maintain

   HC: a well-defined job is done in a class
   LC: a lot of (uncommon) jobs are done in class

   Example:
    HC => class A {
            checkEmail()
            verifyEmail()
            sendEmail()
            printName()
            printAdd()
    }

    LC => class A{
                checkEmail()
            }
            class B{
                verifyEmail()
            }
            class C{
                sendEmail()
            }
            class D{
                printName()
            }
            class D{
                printAdd()
            }

Q2  a) Explain DRY principle and how can we achieve it
    b) Explain the KISS principle with Example.

a) DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
   In coding we aim at reducing or avoiding repetition of information such as navbar, footer, button or icons. If these similar on
   each page or appear frequently on the same page you don't neet to rewrite the code everytime. We can use a module and call it
   where ever required. 

b) KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid
   The goal of ths priciple is to achieve a simple and clear, non-cluttered code that is easy to understand.
   Example-
   var name= n;
   var address= a;
   var number= num;
   var pincode= pin;

   var obj= {
    name: n,
    address: a;
    number: num,
    pincode: pin
   }

Q4. What is a DeadLock ? And what are methods by which we can handle deadLock.

Deadlock situation is where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another
resource acquired by some other process.
Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously
    -Mutual Exclusion: Two or more resources are non-shareable.
    -Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources. 
    -No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource. 
    -Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form. 

Q5. What is a HTTP protocol? Difference between HTTP and HTTPS.

HTTP : Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP is the protocol that is used to transfer data on the web. It is an essential part of the Internet protocol and defines services
used for transmitting webpage data. HTTP uses server-client model i.e computer, laptop, or mobile device as clients. The HTTP server
is typically a web host running web server software.

HTTP status code ranges are:
    1. 1xx: Information
    2. 2xx: Success
    3. 3xx: Redirect
    4. 4xx: Client Error
    5. 5xx: Server Error

Difference Between HTTP & HTTPS
-	HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
    HTTPS for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure.

-	In HTTP the url begins with “http://”.
    In HTTPsthe url begins with “https://”.
    
-   HTTP faster than HTTPS.
    HTTPS slower than HTTP.

-   HTTP is considered to be unsecure.
    HTTPS is considered as secure.
    
-   HTTP does not improve search ranking.
    HTTPS helps in improving search ranking.

-   HTTP works at Application Layer.
    HTTPS works at Transport Layer.
	
-   Encryption is absent in HTTP.
    Encryption is present in HTTPS.
	
-	HTTP does not require any certificates.
    HTTPS needs SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) Certificates.
