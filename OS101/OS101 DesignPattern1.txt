Q.1 There is a BNP(bank note press) that needs three different sizes of
    papers s1, s2 and s3 to print money of the denominations 10, 100 and 1000
    respectively. The BNP gives orders to the paper manufacturer by mentioning
    one of the denominations, and the manufacturer supplies the corresponding
    size of paper.
    E.g. input ->100 â‡’ output-> s2 Implement this scenario using one of the
    design patterns.


Q.2 Explain Singleton Design Pattern with suitable examples.
    Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design
pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to
create an object.
    This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making
sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object
which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

Q.3 What is Eager initialization & Lazy initialization.
The advantages and disadvantages of using Lazy initialization vs Eager initialization.
a:  Lazy initializing an object can save on resources (memory and computation mostly).
a:  With lazy initializing you can defer the instantiation of the object. For example you can
    instantiate a large object or collection after some intensive processing which can help
    improve overall performance by free up resources.
d:  It's a bit overkill if the object that you are lazy loading is small and you know that you
    will need to use it soon after it has been defined.
d:  Can waste lots of resources if managed incorrectly such as wrapping many small objects
    instead of managing them in a Lazy enumerable object or statically.
