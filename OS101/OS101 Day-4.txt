Q3.What is CAP Theorem?
 The Consistency, Availability & Partition Tolerance (CAP) Theorem is comprised of three components as they relate to
    distributed data stores:
        a.  Consistency- receive the most recent write or an error.
        b.  Availability- contain data, but it might not be the most recent.
        c.  Partition tolerance- The system continues to operate despite network failures

    Ihe CAP theorem maintains that when a distributed database experiences a network failure, you can provide either
    consistency or availability.

    In the theorem, partition tolerance is a must. The assumption is that the system operates on a distributed data store so
    the system, by nature, operates with network partitions. Network failures will happen, so to offer any kind of reliable
    service, partition tolerance is necessary.

    That leaves a decision between the other two, C and A. When a network failure happens, one can choose to guarantee
    consistency or availability:
        a.  High consistency comes at the cost of lower availability.
        b.  High availability comes at the cost of lower consistency.
        c.  Consistency in CAP is different than that of ACID. Consistency in CAP means having the most up-to-date
            information. (ACID refers to a different database event. In ACID, consistency means any new transaction
            to the database wonâ€™t corrupt the database.)
